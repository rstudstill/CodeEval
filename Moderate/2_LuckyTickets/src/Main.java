/* Lucky Tickets - Moderate
 * 
 * We can receive a lucky ticket in a public transport. How to reveal whether
 * the ticket is lucky or not? We call a ticket lucky if the sum of its digits
 * in the first half equals to the sum of digits in the second half. For example,
 * ticket 328940 is a lucky one because 3+2+8=9+4+0. 
 * Write a program that will count the maximum number of lucky tickets depending
 * on the length of the ticket number. In other words, how many lucky combinations
 * can be if a ticket number comprises 4, 6, 8, â€¦ digits ?
 * 
 * Input: The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test case
 * with an even number that indicates the length of the ticket number.
 * 
 * Output: Count and print the maximum possible number of lucky tickets depending
 * on the length of the ticket number.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1. The length of a ticket number can be from 2 to 100 digits.
 * 2. Tickets 000000 and 999999 should be also counted.
 * 3. All the input numbers are even.
 * 4. The number of test cases is 40.
